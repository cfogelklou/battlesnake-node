battlesnake-node
================

Please see [http://battlesnake.io] for context.

This is a port of [https://github.com/nimatt/Battlesnake] to node.js using a minimal set of dependencies.

The aim of this project is to provide a very basic starting point and some useful abstractions to get you started on your battlesnake coding.

This code uses [https://expressjs.com/] as a web framework, with [https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser] for json req/res serialization.

Also, [https://nodemon.io/] together with chrome to debug.

Just clone the repository
npm install
npm start

and you will have a battlesnake client running (on port 80) with the --inspect flag; which means you can copy the url that is provided on node startup and paste into a chrome browser to get a live step debugger attached.

Happy coding, and please do not hesitate to contribute fixes!

Best regards,
